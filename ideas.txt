the players get dropped in an arena, dropping random wands and gold nuggets into the arena, then after one kills the other the losing player gets to pick a perk.
Then both players get teleported to a shop area where they can edit their wands and buy spells
after another countdown they get teleported to the arena again
repeat

might have random effects that can happen in the arena each time, like enemies spawning or players getting random buffs or debuffs etc
different each round
