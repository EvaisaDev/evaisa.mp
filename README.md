# noita-online
**A multiplayer gamemode framework for Noita using SteamAPI**  
What it does is implement several of Steam's networking / matchmaking APIs and provides a user interface for lobbies, chat, etc.  
Essentially it makes it easy for mod developers to create online multiplayer gamemodes for Noita, which can even be uploaded to since they do not need to be unsafe.

*List of mods using this framework:*
- [Noita Arena](https://github.com/EvaisaDev/noita-arena) - A party game style online PvP arena mode.
- [Bombermin√§](https://github.com/EvaisaDev/noita-bombergame) - A online PvP bomberman clone.
